# server setUP
const server = new ApolloServer({
# typeDefs
    A schema is a collection of type definitions (hence "typeDefs") that together define the "shape" of queries that are executed against your data.
    
# resolvers
    We've defined our data set, but Apollo Server doesn't know that it should use that data set when it's executing a query. To fix this, we create a resolver. Resolvers tell Apollo Server how to fetch the data associated with a particular type.
