GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries using a type system you define for your data. GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data.

1. Overfetching : getting back more data than we need.
2. Under fetching : getting back less data then we need and then making additional api call
